As part of the DEPI graduation project, we worked on a sales platform called Olist,
based in Brazil. We collected data from 9 CSV files, followed by thorough data exploration and preparation.

We began by cleaning the data, removing outliers, and handling missing values to ensure high data quality.
Important relationships and correlations between features were identified, which helped shape our model-building strategy.

We performed extensive feature engineering, which contributed positively to the modelâ€™s performance during analysis.
Multiple machine learning models were tested, but most of them showed poor accuracy.
CatBoost outperformed the others, delivering the highest accuracy without signs of overfitting.

To enhance model performance, we applied log transformation to the target variable, which significantly improved the results.
Finally, we built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit, allowing users to input order information and receive predictions.
We used MLflow to track experiment results, compare different models, and monitor performance efficiently.

This project offered us valuable hands-on experience in end-to-end machine learning workflows, from data preparation and modeling to deployment and evaluation.
